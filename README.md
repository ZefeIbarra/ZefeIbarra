Hi, @ZefeIbarra!
👨‍🎓 I hold a PhD. in Quantum Optics.
👀 My interests lie in applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to various aspects of physics.
🌱 Currently, I am learning about Machine Learning algorithms in general and their application to identify light patterns in spatial modes.
💞️ I am open to collaborating on different data science projects.
